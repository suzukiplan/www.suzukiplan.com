## Reimagining “Koi-Koi” as a Modern Competitive Game

Battle Hanafuda is based on the traditional Hanafuda ruleset known as *Koi-Koi*, while being carefully redesigned for modern digital play with a strong focus on competitive depth, pacing, and visual clarity.

While preserving the appeal of classic Yaku combinations and strategic mind games, the game emphasizes:

* A user interface and tempo that are easy for beginners to understand
* Short, self-contained matches suitable for competitive play
* Accessibility for players who enjoy digital card games, even without prior Hanafuda experience

The rules follow the widely adopted standard Koi-Koi ruleset used in competitive events, while the game is designed so that complete newcomers can learn naturally through play.

For example, collectible cards are visually highlighted during gameplay, allowing players to instantly understand which cards can be taken.
A Yaku reference can be accessed at any time with a single button press, and every card clearly displays its month and point value, eliminating the need for memorization and lowering the entry barrier for new players.

## Online Multiplayer Available in the Free Demo (Limited Time)

One of the core attractions of Hanafuda is the psychological tension and reading involved in player-versus-player (PvP) matches.
Battle Hanafuda is planned to fully support online multiplayer in the full release.

To allow more players to experience the competitive appeal of Hanafuda, **online multiplayer has been enabled in the free demo for a limited time, from the demo launch through the end of Steam Next Fest 2026 Feb (March 2)**.

The demo supports online play primarily through:

* Friend Matches
* Private Rooms (via shared room codes)

This allows players to enjoy casual online matches with friends and other players worldwide, experiencing the true competitive nature of Hanafuda beyond AI opponents.

## Full Version with Official Online Multiplayer Support

The full version of Battle Hanafuda is planned to feature online multiplayer as a core component, including:

* Online matches with players around the world
* A matchmaking infrastructure designed for future updates
* A smooth and comfortable digital competitive environment

The goal of the project is to establish traditional Hanafuda as a modern online competitive game that can be enjoyed globally.
