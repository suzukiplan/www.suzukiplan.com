## Reimagining Koi-Koi as a Modern Competitive PC Game

Battle Hanafuda is not a digital museum piece or a ruleset simulator.
It is a competitive card game designed from the ground up for **modern PC play**, using the traditional *Koi-Koi* ruleset as a foundation rather than a constraint.

The game emphasizes:

* Short, self-contained matches suitable for repeated competitive play
* Clear, readable visuals optimized for digital screens
* Psychological mind games driven by hidden information and timing
* Minimal reliance on randomness compared to casual card games

While the rules are based on the widely adopted standard Koi-Koi format, the game is carefully tuned so that **players with no prior Hanafuda experience can learn naturally through play**, without studying external rulebooks.

Key usability features include:

* Visual highlights showing which cards can be collected at any moment
* Instant access to a Yaku reference during matches
* Clear display of each card’s month and point value, removing the need for memorization

This allows new players to focus on decision-making and risk assessment, rather than rule recall.

## Online Multiplayer in the Free Demo (Limited Time)

Hanafuda’s core appeal lies in reading the opponent, managing risk, and deciding when to push for points—or when to stop.

To showcase this competitive tension, **online multiplayer is fully enabled in the free demo for a limited time**, from the demo launch until the end of Steam Next Fest 2026 Feb.

The demo supports:

* Friend Matches
* Private Rooms using shared room codes

This allows players to experience real PvP matches instead of AI-only play, highlighting Battle Hanafuda’s focus on competitive mind games rather than single-player optimization.

## Full Version and Ongoing Online Support

The full version of Battle Hanafuda is planned to feature online multiplayer as a core pillar, including:

* Online matches with players worldwide
* A matchmaking infrastructure designed for long-term support
* A stable, low-friction competitive environment for digital card play

The project’s long-term goal is to establish Hanafuda as a **modern competitive card game that works naturally on PC platforms**, without requiring cultural or historical background knowledge.

## Designed for PC and Steam Deck

Battle Hanafuda is designed with **PC and Steam Deck as first-class targets**.

The game runs **natively on Linux and SteamOS**, without relying on Proton, resulting in fast startup times and stable performance on Steam Deck.

The interface is built around a base resolution of **640×400**, scaled cleanly to **1280×800**, ensuring high text readability and full-screen presentation on Steam Deck displays.

Rather than treating handheld compatibility as an afterthought, Battle Hanafuda is designed so that **Steam Deck play feels intentional and comfortable**, making it well-suited for both desktop sessions and portable competitive play.
